### About the Experiment 

High strength metal composites are widely used in artificial body implants; these body implants have very high strength, light in weight and chemically non reactant or stable nature (non toxicity). Generally these artificial implants are manufactured by powder metallurgy (bottom up grain refinement process) or some another kind of high quality metal synthesis process.
