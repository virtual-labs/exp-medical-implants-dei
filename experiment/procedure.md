### Procedure

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol class="procedure-list">
    <li>The billet material suitable for artificial body implants is selected and prepared with required dimensions.</li>
    <li>The billet is initially inspected to ensure it is free from surface defects and impurities.</li>
    <li>The prepared billet is placed inside the Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) die, ensuring proper alignment with the inlet channel.</li>
    <li>A punch is positioned at the entrance of the die to apply compressive force on the billet.</li>
    <li>High pressure is applied using a hydraulic press, forcing the billet to pass through the angular channel without changing its cross-section.</li>
    <li>During pressing, the billet undergoes severe plastic deformation, resulting in grain refinement through the top-down approach.</li>
    <li>The billet is removed from the die after one ECAP pass and allowed to cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Multiple ECAP passes may be performed by rotating the billet between passes to achieve uniform ultra-fine grain structure.</li>
    <li>The processed billet is examined for microstructural refinement and mechanical strength improvement.</li>
    <li>The refined billet is then considered suitable for manufacturing high-strength, lightweight artificial body implants.</li>
