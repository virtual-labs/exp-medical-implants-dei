    {
      "question": "1. What is the main benefit of grain refinement in implant materials?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reduced corrosion resistance",
        "b": "Lower melting temperature",
        "c": "Increased strength and fatigue resistance",
        "d": "Increased brittleness"
      },
         "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Grain refinement generally improves mechanical properties and may even enhance corrosion resistance rather than reduce it.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Grain refinement does not significantly change the melting temperature of a material.",
        "c": "Correct — According to the Hall-Petch relationship, smaller grain size increases strength and improves fatigue resistance, which is crucial for implants.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Grain refinement usually improves toughness and strength, not brittleness."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },

    {
      "question": "2. Why is fatigue resistance important for implants like hip and knee joints?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Exposure to chemicals",
        "b": "Repeated cyclic loading during movement",
        "c": "High operating temperature",
        "d": "Electrical stimulation"
      },
        "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Chemical exposure is related to corrosion resistance, not fatigue failure.",
        "b": "Correct — Hip and knee implants undergo repeated cyclic loads during walking and running, so fatigue resistance prevents crack formation and failure.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Human body temperature is relatively constant and not high enough to cause thermal fatigue.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Orthopedic implants do not function based on electrical stimulation."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"

    {
      "question": "3. Which process improves mechanical properties by plastic deformation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Casting",
        "b": "Welding",
        "c": "Sand molding",
        "d": "Severe plastic deformation"
      },
       "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Casting forms shape but does not significantly improve mechanical properties through plastic strain.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Welding joins materials and may even introduce defects if not controlled properly.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Sand molding is a casting method and does not refine grain structure by plastic deformation.",
        "d": "Correct — Severe plastic deformation refines grain size and enhances strength and mechanical performance."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",

    {
      "question": "4. Why must implant materials be non-toxic?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To avoid adverse biological reactions",
        "b": "To increase surface hardness",
        "c": "To reduce manufacturing cost",
        "d": "To improve machinability"
      },
        "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — Non-toxic materials prevent inflammation, immune response, and tissue damage inside the body.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Surface hardness is a mechanical property and unrelated to toxicity.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Manufacturing cost does not determine biological safety.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Machinability affects fabrication, not biological compatibility."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "5. Which body parts commonly require metallic implants as shown in the experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Skull and ribs",
        "b": "Tooth, elbow, and hip",
        "c": "Fingers only",
        "d": "Neck only"
      },
         "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — While implants can be used in the skull or ribs, they are not the most common load-bearing metallic implant sites.",
        "b": "Correct — Tooth, elbow, and hip joints commonly require metallic implants because they endure mechanical loads.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Implants are not limited to fingers only.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Neck alone is not a common primary site for metallic orthopedic implants."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
