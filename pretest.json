      "question": "1. What is the primary requirement of materials used for medical implants?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High electrical conductivity",
        "b": "High strength and biocompatibility",
        "c": "High thermal expansion",
        "d": "High density"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Electrical conductivity is not the main requirement for most implants.",
        "b": "Correct — Implants must have high strength to bear loads and be biocompatible to avoid rejection.",
        "c": "Incorrect — High thermal expansion may cause dimensional instability inside the body.",
        "d": "Incorrect — High density is not a primary requirement for implant materials."

     {
      "question": "2. Why are metallic materials preferred for orthopedic implants?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They are lightweight only",
        "b": "They are corrosion-free in air",
        "c": "They possess high strength and toughness",
        "d": "They are non-magnetic"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Lightweight alone is not the main reason for selection.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Metals can corrode; special alloys are used for corrosion resistance inside the body.",
        "c": "Correct — Metals provide high strength and toughness needed for load-bearing applications.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Magnetic property is not the primary selection criterion."

     {
      "question": "3. Which property ensures compatibility of implant material with human body tissues?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Hardness",
        "b": "Ductility",
        "c": "Biocompatibility",
        "d": "Density"
      },
        "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Hardness affects wear resistance but not biological compatibility.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Ductility relates to deformation ability, not tissue compatibility.",
        "c": "Correct — Biocompatibility ensures the material does not cause harmful reactions in the body.",
        "d": "Incorrect — Density does not determine tissue compatibility."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

      "question": "4. Load-bearing implants are those which:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Dissolve after implantation",
        "b": "that are used for cosmetic purposes",
        "c": "Conduct electrical signals",
        "d": "Support mechanical loads of the body"
      },
       "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — Dissolving implants are bioresorbable and not typically load-bearing.",
        "b": "Incorrect — Cosmetic implants do not necessarily carry mechanical loads.",
        "c": "Incorrect — Conducting electrical signals is related to devices like pacemakers.",
        "d": "Correct — Load-bearing implants support mechanical forces such as body weight."

      "question": "5. Which of the following is a commonly used orthopedic implant?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Hip joint implant",
        "b": "Cardiac pacemaker",
        "c": "Hearing aid",
        "d": "Contact lens"
      },
       "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — Hip joint implants are widely used in orthopedic surgeries.",
        "b": "Incorrect — A cardiac pacemaker is a cardiac implant, not orthopedic.",
        "c": "Incorrect — A hearing aid is an external assistive device.",
        "d": "Incorrect — A contact lens is an optical device, not an orthopedic implant."
